Identical irritable bowel syndrome symptoms are probably due to different disease processes; grouping patients with this disorder into either diarrhoea-predominant or constipation-predominant subtypes promotes heterogeneity.

Identical irritable bowel syndrome symptoms are probably due to different disease processes; grouping patients with this disorder into either diarrhoea-predominant or constipation-predominant subtypes promotes heterogeneity.",
