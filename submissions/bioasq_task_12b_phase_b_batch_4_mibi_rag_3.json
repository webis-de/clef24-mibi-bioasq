Pediatric glioblastoma cells transduced with wild-type or deletion mutant EGFRvIII were not rendered more sensitive to erlotinib despite expressing wild-type PTEN. Phosphorylated receptor tyrosine kinase profiling showed a specific activation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha/beta in EGFRvIII-transduced pediatric glioblastoma cells, and targeted coinhibition with erlotinib and imatinib leads to enhanced efficacy in this model.",
