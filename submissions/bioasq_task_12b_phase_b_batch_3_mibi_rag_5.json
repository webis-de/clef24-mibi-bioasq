Identical irritable bowel syndrome symptoms are probably due to different disease processes; grouping patients with this disorder into either diarrhoea-predominant or constipation-predominant subtypes promotes heterogeneity. An approach based on the underlying pathophysiology could help to develop therapies that target causes and ultimately provide a cure for patients with irritable bowel syndrome.",
