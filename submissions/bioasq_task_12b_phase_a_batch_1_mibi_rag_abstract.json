However, studies have also shown that Ebola can be transmitted via the respiratory tract in nonhuman primates and through mucosal infection in guinea pigs. Additionally, sexual transmission has been demonstrated in humans, as the virus can persist in the testes. It is important to note that transmission can occur without direct contact if infectious materials are present, and longer contact times increase the likelihood of transmission.",

Routine vaccination supplemented by planned campaigns has been the core strategy for measles control and elimination efforts. Vaccination helps to build immunity against the measles virus, preventing infection and reducing the risk of transmission. It is a cost-effective intervention that has been proven to be highly effective in reducing measles cases and outbreaks. However, it is important to note that the success of measles immunization programs also depends on factors such as vaccine coverage, access to healthcare, and public awareness.
