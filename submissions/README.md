# Submissions

In this file, we briefly describe what approaches we submitted to BioASQ:

- Batch 1:
  - Phase A:
    - `mibi_rag_abstract`:
      - Retrieve 200 documents with PubMed API (using the question text as query; removing the last query term until the result set is not empty anymore).
      - Re-rank with BM25 (k1=1.5, b=0.75, epsilon=0.25, concatenated title and abstract, NLTK tokenizer, excluding NLTK stopwords and punctuation, case-insensitive).
      - Cut-off at top-50.
      - Re-rank with cross-encoder (cross-encoder/msmarco-MiniLM-L6-en-de-v1, only abstract).
      - Cut-off at top-25.
      - Re-rank with bi-encoder (sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2, only abstract).
      - Cut-off at top-10.
      - **How are snippets generated?**
      - **Why/how are answers generated?**
    - `mibi_rag_snippet`:
      - Retrieve documents the same as `mibi_rag_abstract`.
      - Generate snippets with GPT-3.5 (turbo, **temperature?**, **max tokens?**) chain-of-thought few-shot prompting ([prompt](notebooks/test_templates.py)).
      - **Why/how are answers generated?**
  - Phase A+:
    - `mibi_rag_abstract`:
      - Retrieve documents the same as `mibi_rag_abstract` (Phase A).
      - Use top-3 abstracts concatenated as context for answer generation.
      - Generate an exact answer to the question with GPT-3.5 (turbo, **temperature?**, **max tokens?**) zero-shot prompting ([prompt](notebooks/test_utils.py)), with 4 response models depending on the question type.
      - Generate an"ideal" (long-form) answer to the question with GPT-3.5 (turbo, **temperature?**, **max tokens?**) zero-shot prompting ([prompt](notebooks/test_utils.py)), with 2 response models depending on the question type.
    - `mibi_rag_snippet`:
      - Retrieve documents and snippets the same as `mibi_rag_snippet` (Phase A).
      - Use all (top-10) snippets concatenated as context for answer generation.
      - Generate an exact answer to the question the same as `mibi_rag_abstract`.
      - Generate an "ideal" answer to the question the same as `mibi_rag_abstract`.
  - Phase B:
    - `mibi_rag_abstract`:
      - **Retrieve or use provided documents/snippets?**
      - Use all (top-10) snippets concatenated as context for answer generation.
      - Generate an exact answer to the question the same as `mibi_rag_abstract` (Phase A+).
      - Generate an "ideal" answer to the question the same as `mibi_rag_abstract` (Phase A+).
    - `mibi_rag_snippet`:
      - **Retrieve or use provided documents/snippets?**
      - Generate an exact answer to the question the same as `mibi_rag_snippet` (Phase A+).
      - Generate an "ideal" answer to the question the same as `mibi_rag_snippet` (Phase A+).
- Batch 2:
  - Phase A:
    - `mibi_rag_abstract`:
      - Index PubMed 2024 baseline in Elasticsearch (including metadata).
      - Retrieve from
