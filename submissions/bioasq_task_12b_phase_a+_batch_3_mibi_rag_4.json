The rates of breast milk-acquired CMV infection, CMV-related symptoms, and CMV-related sepsis-like syndrome (CMV-SLS) in LBW and premature infants were pooled from each study.",

      "ideal_answer": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a complex disorder with multiple mechanisms that contribute to its pathophysiology. These mechanisms include visceral hypersensitivity, altered gut motility, low-grade inflammation, and dysbiosis. Psychological factors such as stress, anxiety, and depression may also play a role. Additionally, abnormal gut motility, disturbed neural function of the brain-gut axis, and an abnormal autonomic nervous system are implicated in disease progression. Recent studies suggest that low-grade inflammation, altered gut microbiota, and alteration in the gut immune system may also be important etiological factors.",
